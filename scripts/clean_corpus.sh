#!/bin/bash
# 
# Clean a corpus of text (one document per line) to train static word 
# embeddings. Removes non-ascii characters, lowercases, removes punctuation 
# except for the apostrophes of contractions and possessive 's. Tokens are 
# words, contractions (except n't is not a separate token), and the possessive 
# 's. For example, "he's" is separated into "he" and "'s", but "don't" is kept
# as "don't".
# 
# NOTES:
#   - TRANSLIT is important to remove accents (eg. á -> a).
#   - All non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with a single space except 
#     for dash (-) and apostrophe (')
#   - Numbers are separated into tokens (eg. "20,000.00" -> "20000 00") 
#   - There might be some remaining dashes (-) and apostrophes (') in the 
#     output of weird documents
#   - Acronyms are supposed to be kept w/out trailing dot (eg. "U.S.A." -> "u.s.a.")
#     This is done with a weird workaround because sed doesn't support lookahead. 
#   - Borramos square brackets [] porque hay muchas expresiones como:
#        >[Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an 
#        >Kohl said that "[t]he darkest
#        >to "law school" and "med[ical] school"
#        >His name was [[Gregory of Cappadocia]].
